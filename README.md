# DataAtlas_PY

**Data Atlas** is a Python-based data exploration tool that lets you load structured datasets (like CSV or JSON), perform flexible searches across fields, and experiment with different data structures and search algorithms.

The goal of this project is to reinforce foundational data structure concepts (such as lists, dictionaries, and trees), implement search algorithms in a real-world context, and build a tool that is both practical and extensible.

## âœ¨ Features

- Load datasets from CSV or JSON
- Search records by field and value (e.g., filter all items with `type = Fire`)
- Compare search strategies like linear search, hash-based lookup, and binary search
- Command-line interface for easy interaction
- Extensible structure to support more advanced algorithms (e.g., trie, sorting, indexing)
